# lfwebsite

This is my personal website available under: https://lennartfuchs.com/

I am completely new to web development. 
I started from zero. I did not know HTML, let alone CSS, or jQuery. 
Yet, I challenged myself to create a website by myself, without any professional help or online builders. 

I know the code is not perfect, but I'm quite happy with the result on the front-end.
This has been a personal project I just started working on when I had no clode what I was doing whatsover and at some point progressed to what it is now.
